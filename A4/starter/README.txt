Notes:

 * The data structures for objects and rays have been updated - you will need to modify your code
   to use the new data structures (don't be surprised by compilation errors stating there are missing
   variables and such within the data structures)
 * Your first task should be to port any code you need from your ray tracer to the path tracer starter
   and update it to work with the new data structures
 * You can port your scene from A3 if you want to use it for A4 (but you should improve on it!!)
   - or - define a new cool scene for A4
 * Don't forget to complete the autotester_id.txt
 * If you have done any crunchy work, put your rendered images (in .jpg format, good resolution)
   along with a text file describing your crunchy features in a .zip file called 'crunchy.zip'
   and submit that along with the remaning requested files and/or renders.
